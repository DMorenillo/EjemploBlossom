Blossom sample module
-----------------------

Very simplistic example of a module using Blossom and Spring. Includes a template with two areas and a component. For
more examples of templates and components see the sample webapp project.

Drop it into a magnolia webapp or add it to the pom of magnolia webapp project.

Using it with the Blossom sample webapp won't work due to name clashes on the classpath.
